## Description
CellularAutomatown is a project which was born for a game jam about Bio design and the city. It currently lets you toy with it's mechanics and do one click terraforming to influence the environment (which is generated by algorithm).

## Agent algorithms
#### Cities:
This visual shows a small city forming by algorithm

and a big city by a similar type of means.

#### Flora:
This algorithm focuses on the propagation on the flora by simple means,

once it has comfortably spread out and that units start to perish, the algorithm invests in maintaining it's population and not only spreading out, this is why you can see it stagnating to a certain size

## Environment algorithms

Terrain evolves with pseudo erosion rules.  
You can paint the terrain by clicking first on an altitude and then by dragging to paint it.

### Height map with color style

So water help the growth of ground and fertile zone.  
The sun angle has an impact on the fertile zone.
