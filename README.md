## Algorithmes
#### Cities:
This is the visual reprensentation of a small city forming by algorithme

and a big city by a similar type of means.

#### Flora:
This algorithme focuses on the propagation on the flora by simple means,

once it has comfortably spread out and that units start to perish, the algorithme invests in maintaining it's population and not only spreading out, this is why you can see it stagnating to a certain size
