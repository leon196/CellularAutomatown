## Description
CellularAutomatown is a project which was born for a game jam about Bio design and the city. It currently lets you toy with it's mechanics and do one click terraforming to influence the environement (which is generated by algorithme).

#### Downloads
[Windows (GameJam public alpha build)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/148910712981422080/195678544993583105/Automatown.rar) =>  [[Virus Total Scan]](https://www.virustotal.com/fr/file/3fd82066b3a246896e36fbbf8bc4d9ea4698b352bfb1cbe70c9ce60f16b22261/analysis/1466723574/)



## Algorithmes
#### Cities:
This is the visual reprensentation of a small city forming by algorithme

and a big city by a similar type of means.

#### Flora:
This algorithme focuses on the propagation on the flora by simple means,

once it has comfortably spread out and that units start to perish, the algorithme invests in maintaining it's population and not only spreading out, this is why you can see it stagnating to a certain size
